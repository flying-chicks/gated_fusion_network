# A Deep Multimodal Fusion Framework For Recognizing Faculty Homepages

## Main components 
 This framework mainly consists of two components: Multimodal Generative Adversarial Nets and Gated Fusion Network.

1. **Multimodal Generative Adversarial Nets** is used to synthesize fake features with interactions between them to rebalance webpage dataset.
 
2. **Gated Fusion Network** is designed for fusing three-modal features from webpages to recognize faculty homepages deployed in a web-crawler.
